Q1
Object Oriented programming is a programming style which is associated with the concepts like class, object,
Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism.this is also help full for Real world programming.We first
create class and of that class we make instance of class also know as object.OOP include two important things attributes
and behaviors.Attributes differentiate it from other class. Behaviors tell what task which object perform
Q2
BENEFITS OF OOP
->It implements real life scenario.
->In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures.
->OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.
->It is good for defining abstract data types.
->Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.
->It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing
ones.
->objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these 
particular languages
->encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.
Q3

Method is define inside the class and define the behavior of object.
Function can be define anywhere in the program.

Q4
Class define the attributes of an object.
Object is instance of class.
Attributes store the information about Object.
Behavior tells what task will the object perform.
